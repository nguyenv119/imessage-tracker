## Architecture Diagram

To add the architecture diagram:

1. Save the Mermaid diagram as `architecture.png`
2. Place it in this directory as `sus/images/architecture.png`

The diagram shows the complete flow from the iMessage database through the Rust components to the output files.

## Generating the Diagram

You can generate the diagram from the Mermaid code using:
- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
- [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
- VS Code with Mermaid extension

The dark mode diagram code is included in the project documentation.
